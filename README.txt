Description:
----
This is the recently Update of WinDOS2, with new UI but old functions

Istallation
----
Installation is very easy. Download all the files from this repository (You can choose your version) AND remember to install all the files needed. I have placed an Installation Package there for lazy people.

Using WinDOS:
----
If you have lost your BOOT.ini file, you'll get the blue screen. If you see the Blue Screen first time, press any key to shut the Blue Screen and install the BOOT.ini file. If you have seen the Blue Screen multiple times, contact us for directions.

Note:
----
Please placed all the files that not named "WinDOS3.bat" in a folder called SYS (The system won't work well if you don't do that) and placed the "WinDOS3.bat" outside. Please change all the files direction like "D:\LTD\Windows Batch Project\WinDOS3" to your directions, or ot won't work well on you computer.
